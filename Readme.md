# What is Potholes 

A framework of code designed to enable high-level synthesis using the polyhedral model. 

The tool makes extensive use of tools from other researchers. 

1. PET and ISL for frontend polyhedral analysis and backend code generation. 
2. Vivado HLS for high-level synthesis. 

# Why should I use it ?

It will help you get started with research into polyhedral compiler techniques by building transforms

# What will I need to build in order to use it ? 

* itcl
* tcllib
* pet 0.04
* isl from pet submodule
* Clang / LLVM 3.3
